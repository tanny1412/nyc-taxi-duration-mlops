 ## Project Overview

 Predicting the duration of taxi rides in New York City is a classic regression problem with real-world business applications. This repository provides:

 - A reproducible data pipeline with DVC for versioning raw, interim, and processed datasets.
 - Feature engineering driven by modular Python code.
 - Model training and hyperparameter tuning with MLflow for experiment tracking.
 - Serialization and versioning of models using DVC and MLflow Model Registry.
 - A lightweight FastAPI service to serve predictions in real-time.
 - Containerization with Docker for consistent deployments.
 - CI/CD-ready structure with Makefile and tox for testing.

 ## Key Features

 - End-to-end ML pipeline: from raw data ingestion to production-ready API.
 - Data versioning and pipeline orchestration with DVC.
 - Experiment tracking, logging, and model registry with MLflow.
 - Feature engineering encapsulated in reusable modules.
 - High-performance XGBoost models (or scikit-learn RandomForest).
 - Automated testing and linting (pytest, flake8, mypy).
 - Dockerized application for easy deployment.
 - Clear project structure for collaborative development.

 ## Architecture & Technologies

 - **Language**: Python 3.8+
 - **Data Versioning**: DVC
 - **Experiment Tracking**: MLflow
 - **Web Framework**: FastAPI & Uvicorn
 - **Modeling**: XGBoost or scikit-learn RandomForest
 - **Data Processing**: Pandas, NumPy
 - **Deployment**: Docker, Makefile
 - **Testing & CI**: pytest, tox, flake8, mypy

 ## Getting Started

 ### Prerequisites
 - Git
 - Python 3.8+
 - pip
 - DVC
 - MLflow
 - Docker (optional, for container builds)

 ### Installation
 ```bash
 git clone https://github.com/<yourusername>/trip-duration.git
 cd trip-duration
 pip install -r requirements.txt
 pip install -e .
 dvc pull           # fetch data and model artifacts
 ```

 ### Data Pipeline
 Generate and process datasets:
 ```bash
 make data
 # or
 dvc repro
 ```
 - Raw data → cleaned and split into `data/processed/train.csv` and `data/processed/test.csv`.

 ### Training & Experiments
 Train models and log experiments:
 ```bash
 make train
 # or
 python -m src.models.train_model
 ```
 - Hyperparameters and metrics are recorded to the MLflow server (`mlruns/`).
 - Model artifacts are versioned with DVC.

 Launch the MLflow UI to compare runs:
 ```bash
 mlflow ui
 ```

 ### Serving Predictions
 Start the FastAPI service:
 ```bash
 uvicorn service:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8080
 ```

 Example request:
 ```bash
 curl -X POST "http://localhost:8080/predict" \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -d '{
           "vendor_id": 2,
           "pickup_datetime": 1700000000,
           "passenger_count": 1,
           "pickup_longitude": -73.985,
           "pickup_latitude": 40.748,
           "dropoff_longitude": -73.975,
           "dropoff_latitude": 40.752,
           "store_and_fwd_flag": 0
         }'
 ```
